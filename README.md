# AWS automation
AWS EC2, S3 and some other (lambda, SNS, CloudWatch, CloudTrail etc) automation scripts (deployment, cleaning, maintenance). the idea is to: run a script and have already fully defined, working environment with all needed services, and appropriately configured policies and secure groups... On the other hands to have a tool, to fully clean AWS AccoundID env.

Because it is a cloud environemnt and some things takes time (deployment of instance, instance being actually up, creating snapshot or image) - all commands are checking if resource is already available 

**BE AWARE:** due to not having permissions to VPCs, nor IGWs - those are not checked if exists, not checked if properly attached (IGW to VPC), also networks are not created, but they are already checked if exist... 

## prerequisites:
- already created VPC, IGW and subnet (usually defined by default, tested on newly created free tier account)
- created IAM named profile - scripts won't run without providing profile name
- few initial VARIABLES:

## purpose

The main purpose of this repo is to - using only CLI, and as less as possible manual work - create automatically an environemnt for doing some tasks on the fly:
- create tight security group which only ads deployed IP and ssh protocol to access to EC2 instance(s)
- create policy
- create role
- attach role to policy
- create an instance profile
- add that role to instance profile
- create an EC2 instance based on an image (own images, but it is very easy to change it to standard one) - choosing the newest one if more
  - each instance when started notifies itself on slack channel
  - each instance when shut down - notifies itself on slack channel (services definitions are in the repo already)
- assign created instance profile to that instance
- assign security policy to the instance 
- create S3 bucket(s) with secure access and encrypted by default
- create a KeyPair - checking if there is already an ssh key of deployer to import it in case
  - use it in case there is something to do remotely
  - remote script functions are prepared to be deployed in background logging output, which is presented with the rest of output
- present details in nice output, with all monthly and annualy costs so far
- send appropriate notifications to slack channel - also nicely formatted
  - about costs
  - about own AMIs
  - about working/running instances
  - about volumes 

And also:
- clean the whole environment - if needed:
  - all instance profiles, roles, policies
  - all security groups
  - all instances
  - all volumes
  - all keypairs
  - leaving only own AMIs, and S3 buckets
  
## AWS extra addons

- SSM agent manual installation:
  - **[SSM rpm](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-eu-west-1/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm)**
  - ```aws ssm start-session --region=eu-west-1 --target [instance_id]```
- packages and configuration management: *cloudformation* or *terraform*
- reconfiguration ssh port to 2222:
  - (SELinux) ```semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 2222```
